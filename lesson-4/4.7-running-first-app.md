# 4.7 Running Your First Application

### Reminders
- `kubectl delete pod [POD_NAME]` may not have the the expected results if replica sets are being used.
    - When replica sets are being used, pods are controlled by the replica sets and the replica sets are being controlled by the deployment.
    - Therefore, to delete a pod, the deployment would need to be deleted using `kubectl delete deploy [DEPLOYMENT_NAME]`.
    - If there are any related services, clean them up with `kubectl delete svc [SERVICE_NAME]`.
