3. **Create and Manage Deployments**: Use `kubectl` to create, update, and scale deployments.
4. **Work with ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Store and manage configuration data and sensitive information.
5. **Use Labels and Selectors**: Efficiently manage and query Kubernetes resources.

### **Application Deployment**
6. **Deploy Applications**: Use manifests to deploy applications.
7. **Rolling Updates and Rollbacks**: Perform rolling updates and rollbacks on deployments.

### **Application Observability and Maintenance**
8. **Monitor Applications**: Use tools like `kubectl top` and logs to monitor application performance.
9. **Debugging**: Troubleshoot common issues in Kubernetes clusters.

### **Application Environment, Configuration, and Security**
10. **Manage Resource Quotas and Limits**: Set and manage resource quotas and limits for namespaces.
11. **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to secure communication between pods.
