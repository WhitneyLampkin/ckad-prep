# Lesson 8 Lab: Managing Services

1. Configure a Service for the Nginx Deployment created in Demo 8. Ensure that the service makes Nginx accessible through port 80, using ClusterIp type. Verify that it works.
2. Change the type to NodePort and expose the Service on port 32000.
3. Verify the Service is accessible on this node port.
